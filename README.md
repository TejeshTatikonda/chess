# chess

Notation:
black player's pieces --> small letters (r-rook, n-knight, b-bishop, k-king, q-queen, p-pawn).
white player's pieces --> capital letters (R-rook, N-knight, B-bishop, K-king, Q-queen, P-pawn).

Features:
we can load any position of a chess board's position with the help of FEN string. (currently hard coded in the code) need to make it as a user input.

if we run this code, it will ask for a square to select. we have to enter a square coordinate(eg: a2, e5). it will find what type of piece is there in that square and finds its all possible moves as per so far implemented.
